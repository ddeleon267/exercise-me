# README

Exercise-Me is a simple Rails app that allows users to create and share exercises and workout routines. A user may sign up via the site itself or with Twitter, sign out, and log in. Users are able to browse existing exercises or add new exercises to the database, including information on the muscle group targeted or whether specific equipment is needed. Users can also create workout routines, including set and rep details, either including existing exercises from the database or adding new exercises from the same form. Note that this app allows users to browse routines added by other users, but a user may only edit or delete workout routines that have been added by that user.
